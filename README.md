## Installation

* [Using Arduino IDE Boards Manager](https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards) (Reccomended)
    * Follow the instructions at the [SparkFun Arduino Boards Repo](https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards)
    * Open 'Boards Manager' and select 'SparkFun Apollo3 Boards,' install the latest version.
    * JSON boards manager link for convenience: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Boards/master/IDE_Board_Manager/package_sparkfun_index.json



## Development Status

The basic necesseties are in-place. This means that you can compile and upload code to your Apollo3 board. Development can be done with the whole range of Hardware Abstraction Layer functions provided in the AmbiqSuite Software Development Kit (based on Release2.1.0). 

Current focus is to begin building support for the essential Arduino libraries including:
  * Serial: Fully implemented (will fix bugs and tweak performance over time)
  * GPIO
    * Working:
      * ditigal functions (read / write)
      * analogRead
      * analogWrite
      * interrupts
  * Timing
    * Working:
      * delay
      * delayMicroseconds
      * millis
      * micros
      * seconds (extension)
  * Wire
    * Working: 90% use case, master I2C interface. 
  * SPI
    * Working: transfers with SPISettings.



## How to Contribute
The goal of this Arduino Core is to provide excellent Apollo3 support in a clear and extendable manner. The guidelines for contributing and submitting issues are designed to make it easy to integrate work from many people.
