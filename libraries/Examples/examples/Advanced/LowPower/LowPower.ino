  A big thanks to robin_hodgson for pointing out the HFRC shutdown requirement.

  SparkFun labored with love to create this code. Feel like supporting open source hardware?

  How close can we get to 2.7uA in deep sleep?
  This example shows how decrease the Artemis current consumption to less than ~2.5uA in deep sleep.

  Note that Artemis modules with revision A1 silicon will use ~30uA. Please see the
  Ambiq errata for more information: https://www.ambiqmicro.com/static/mcu/files/Apollo3_Blue_Errata_List_v1_0_external_release.pdf

  To monitor the current to the Edge cut the MEAS jumper, solder in headers, and attach
  a DMM via IC hooks (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/506).

  The USB to serial bridge draws some current:
    Serial Basic C - ~1.2uA (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15096)
    FTDI Basic - ~5.5uA (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9873)

  The various components on the Edge2 can be powered on/off as well
    PDM microphones (2) - ~50.9uA
    Accelerometer (POR mode) - ~79.7uA
    Camera regulator enabled (no camera) - ~96.8uA

  // Disabling the debugger GPIOs saves about 1.2 uA total:
  am_hal_gpio_pinconfig(20 /* SWDCLK */, g_AM_HAL_GPIO_DISABLE);
  am_hal_gpio_pinconfig(21 /* SWDIO */, g_AM_HAL_GPIO_DISABLE);

  // These two GPIOs are critical: the TX/RX connections between the Artemis module and the CH340S on the Blackboard
  // are prone to backfeeding each other. To stop this from happening, we must reconfigure those pins as GPIOs
  // and then disable them completely:
  am_hal_gpio_pinconfig(48 /* TXO-0 */, g_AM_HAL_GPIO_DISABLE);
  am_hal_gpio_pinconfig(49 /* RXI-0 */, g_AM_HAL_GPIO_DISABLE);

  // The default Arduino environment runs the System Timer (STIMER) off the 48 MHZ HFRC clock source.
  // The HFRC appears to take over 60 uA when it is running, so this is a big source of extra
  // current consumption in deep sleep.
  // For systems that might want to use the STIMER to generate a periodic wakeup, it needs to be left running.
  // However, it does not have to run at 48 MHz. If we reconfigure STIMER (system timer) to use the 32768 Hz
  // XTAL clock source instead the measured deepsleep power drops by about 64 uA.
  am_hal_stimer_config(AM_HAL_STIMER_CFG_CLEAR | AM_HAL_STIMER_CFG_FREEZE);

  // This option selects 32768 Hz via crystal osc. This appears to cost about 0.1 uA versus selecting "no clock"
  am_hal_stimer_config(AM_HAL_STIMER_XTAL_32KHZ);

  // This option would be available to systems that don't care about passing time, but might be set
  // to wake up on a GPIO transition interrupt.
